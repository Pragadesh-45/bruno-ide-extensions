## Bruno - Opensource IDE for exploring and testing api's. 
Bruno is a new and innovative API client, aimed at revolutionizing the status quo represented by Postman and similar tools out there.

Bruno stores your collections directly in a folder on your filesystem. We use a plain text markup language, Bru, to save information about API requests.

You can use git or any version control of your choice to collaborate over your api collections.
